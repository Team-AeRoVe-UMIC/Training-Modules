# Training-Modules
Contains subsystem specific training modules <br />
This is the branch for controls.<br />
The first folder contains Jupyter notebooks having code for basic vehicle dynamics, PID control and finally applications of these concepts in 1D control, and cascaded control in 2 and 3 dimensions. It also conatins notebooks on polynomial segmentation and minimum snap trajectory generation. <br />
The second folder contains tuning assignments from the Coursera course on aerial robotics. The code for simulating, plotting and comparing expected to observed trajectories was already written in the files provided, and we only had to fill in code for the controller. <br />
The third folder contains the mavros assignment which includes code for arming, changing mode, takeoff and landing, as well as following a pre-specified trajectory using setpoint_position topic and plotting the trajectory followed using matplotlib. <br/>
Summary and screenshots of some important theory covered in both courses can be found here.<br />
