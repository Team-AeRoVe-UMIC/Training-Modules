*This link:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MuK6vTJQC3nsSfQkPhU_jaq8XQlOi85cbHek9mTFjV0/edit
contains the learning path in a very detailed fashion.
*But to tell you in short...
The multirotor links tells you about fight dynamics

Learning solidworks is very important, so after watching the tutorial, try making some real life objects to get some good pratice
 of it.
 
The electronics link tells you about all the electronic parts that are used to make the drone, their specifications, models, 
 price and all. You dont need to memorize it, but take a look on it.
