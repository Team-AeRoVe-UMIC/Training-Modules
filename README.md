# Motion Planning goes here
Hello new recruits, after the intense round of selection and training you finally made it to the Motion Planning subsystem. Congratulations to being a part of the best subsystem of AeRoVe.
You must all be a bit familiar to the workings of the subsystem from your training days(and probably sleepless nights ;) )
In a way to get more informed to the subsystem and to transform you all into pros I am listing some resources which I beleive will give you many insights into the finer details involved in MP.
