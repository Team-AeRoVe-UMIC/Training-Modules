# AeRoVe_ML_CV_Training
 Team AeRoVe ML/CV Training from start to end.
 
 The folder named "PHASE_0" contains resources and assignments for opencv and python.
 
 Refer to "PHASE_1 ML Training" which covers linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, K-Means, KNN, and PCA.
 
 "PHASE_1" contains the two mini projects mentioned in PHASE_1 ML Training. 
 Mini Project 1 requires to find the best linear regression model that accurately predicts wine quality given some number of input features.
 Would recommend to complete course 2 (optimisation) of coursera before attempting this project.
 Mini Project 2 is based on dimensionality reduction using PCA.
 Approach this question both ways - with and without sklearn.
