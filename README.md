# Motion Planning goes here
<section>Hello new recruits,</section> 

<section>After the intense round of selection and training you finally made it to the Motion Planning subsystem. Congratulations to being a part of the best subsystem of AeRoVe.</section>  

<br></br>

<section>You must all be a bit familiar to the workings of the subsystem from your training days and probably sleepless nights ðŸ˜¹
In a way to get more informed about the subsystem and to transform you all into pros we are listing some resources which I beleive will give you many insights into the finer details involved in MP.</section>
